            For this assignment, I wanted to play around with a press-kit fit of some traingular shapes.
            I took a break from work a little bit to drive to Home Depot and bought myself some calipers so that
            I can measure some leftover Home Depot boxes that I had from my last move.

            </p>
            <p>
            After the measurements, I created a rectangular subtractions to my traingular shapes that would measure out to the depth of
            cardboard boxes.

            <p>
            Here I am making sure that the corners are rounded, so that the press-fit parts would fit better.

            </p>
            <p>
            Keeping in mind of the cardboard box dimension I have, I decided to divvy up my prints into 2 sessions,
            as shown in my illustrator file below.

            </p>
            <p>
            With the parts laser cut, I constructed some random structures - trying to stack them as high as possible.
