            <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>

            <p>
                For my final project, I would like to create a music box. Mainly, the music box spool that includes the music
                annotation will be programmable by Grasshopper, and will be able to be easily removed/added to the music box, allowing
                for easy customization of songs for the music box.
            </p>

            <h3>Contingency Plan</h3>

            <p>
                Since I will not have access to my 3D printer over the holidays, until November 28th, I will focus on modeling my designs until then. I am trying to give
                myself a few days for final assembly, as well as optional assignment of milling my brass sheet to create a music comb, rather than using a pre-built part.
            </p>

            <h3>Bill of Materials</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Music Box Comb - Ordered, arriving Nov 23rd ($10)</li>
                <li>Music Box Comb Screws - Ordered, arriving Nov 23rd</li>
                <li>Brass Sheet (1mm/2mm) - Ordered, arriving Nov 29th ($60)</li>

                <li>3D Printer / PLA Filament - Acquired</li>
            </ul>
