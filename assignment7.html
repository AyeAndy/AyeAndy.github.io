            <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>

            <p>
                For my final project, I would like to create a music box. Mainly, the music box spool that includes the music
                annotation will be programmable by Grasshopper, and will be able to be easily removed/added to the music box, allowing
                for easy customization of songs for the music box.
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>Music Cylinder/Spool</h3>
            
            <img src="img/assignment7/spool.png" width=800></a>

            <p>
                The music cylinder will be programmed in grasshopper. The pointcloud generated from my notes CSV will then be transformed
                and applied to a cylinder solid polysurface, which will create extrusions on the cylinder for the note delineation.
                <br>
                <br>
                Originally, I wanted to leverage flat.io's API to convert my custom music notation into data points using Python so that
                the translational work would become a lot easier. However, due to time constraints, I will do manual calculations in spreadsheet
                format.
            </p>

            <p>
                Above is an example of how I converted first few measures of Arirang into point clouds, that will then be mapped in grasshopper into a cylinder.
                I leveraged an existing STL file on thingiverse (music box for Super Mario theme), which will be base a lot of my fabrication base.
            </p>

            <h3>Note Comb</h3>

            <img src="img/assignment7/comb.png" width=800></a>
            <br>
            <img src="img/assignment7/note_comb_amazon.png" width=800></a>

            <p>
                I'm worried about finishing my project on time, so I actually ordered a music comb part online. This will arrive tomorrow, but
                I also ordered brass sheets just in case I may have more time to incorporate subtractive manufacturing with CNC mill. Even if I don't 
                include subtractive manufacturing, I will still be able to include 4 fabrication methods we learned in class.
            </p>

            <h3>Cogs & Levers</h3>

            <img src="img/assignment7/rhino_cogs.png" width=800></a>

            <p>
                I'll be leveraging an stl for <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:72787">Super Mario Music Box</a> from thingiverse to guide creating
                cogs and levers. Hopefully, this will help in making my project overhead a lot simpler. Traditional music boxes usually contain spring housing
                to allow the cylinder/spool to rotate with constant velocity, but to finish the project by Dec 9th, the music box I will create will require
                manual movement input via lever and cogs.
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>Music Box Exterior</h3>

            <img src="img/assignment7/music_box_exterior.png" width=800></a>

            <p>
                The music box will include a cardboard exterior, with potential room for custom engravings. The parts will be press-fit so that the notes cylinder/spool
                can be removed easily for switching between various music.
            </p>

            <h3>Contingency Plan</h3>
            <img src="img/assignment7/Contigency_Plan.png" width=1200></a>

            <p>
                Since I will not have access to my 3D printer over the holidays, until November 28th, I will focus on modeling my designs until then. I am trying to give
                myself a few days for final assembly, as well as optional assignment of milling my brass sheet to create a music comb, rather than using a pre-built part.

                <br>
                <br>
                While I'm in DC, I also searched up a makerspace nearby that I could potentially go to over the weekend to print some of my materials, if I do finish early.
                I also have some PTO left for the calendar year for work, so I will be leveraging that for one of the days, if things get too busy.
            </p>
