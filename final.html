            <h1>Final Project: Music Box</h1>

            <p>
                For my final project, I decided to create a music box and test efficacies of digitally fabricating musical instruments or artifacts.
            </p>

            <img src="img/final/3.png" width=1200></a>

            <p>
                For this project, I used techniques that included 3d printing, grasshopper, laser cutting, and press-fit construction.
                Detailed project specifications can be found in my <a href="./assignment7.html">Final Project Proposal</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                I based much of my designs from a previously existing stl online of a <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:72787">Super Mario Music Box</a> to make
                this assignment easier.
            </p>

            <h3>Customized Music Cylinder</h3>
            
            <img src="img/final/5.png" width=1200></a>
            <br>

            <p>
                The music cylinder was programmed in grasshopper. The pointcloud generated from my notes CSV was then be transformed
                and applied to a cylinder solid polysurface, which createed extrusions on the cylinder for the note delineation.
                <br>
                <br>
                Originally, I wanted to leverage flat.io's API to convert my custom music notation into data points using Python so that
                the translational work would become a lot easier. However, due to time constraints, I conducted manual calculations in spreadsheet
                format.
            </p>

            <img src="img/final/6.png" width=1200></a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="img/final/7.png" width=1200></a>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>
                After doing some calculations in Google Spreadsheet, I mapped out the points into a coordinate point system in Grasshopper. I created a mesh
                that resembles the tick marks on the music cylinders and assigned them to the points, which then was mapped onto a cylinder using the 
                FlowOnSrf command in Rhino.

            <h3>Cylinder Mesh & Fit</h3>

            <img src="img/final/17.png" width=1200></a>
            <br>

            <p>
                I wanted to make the music box customization easier  - I wanted to allow someone else to easily print out and assemble the music box. The stl
                that I used was difficult to assemble, and lacked some aspects of easy construction.
            </p>

            <img src="img/final/12.png" width=1200></a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="img/final/9.png" width=1200></a>

            <p>
                To make assembling easier, I modified the mesh in the stl that allowed the music cylinder to stay in plalce with a dowel-based system. With this,
                the user can simply remove the cylinder from the slots inserted.
            </p>
            

            <img src="img/final/11.png" width=1200></a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="img/final/16.png" width=1200></a>

            <p>
                For the cylinder to rotate without the compression-based system of the original stl file, I decided to create a slot within the cylinder
                that would allow for a dowel to be inserted. The dowel also included extensions to allow the cylinder to rotate around, as the cogs were
                already attached the to the cylinder itself.
            </p>

            <h3>Music Box Exterior</h3>

            <img src="img/final/18.png" width=1200></a>

            <p>
                Originally, I planned to have the whole exterior of the music box constructed in cardboard; however, due to the cardboard not being able to handle
                forces and stresses produced by cogwheel rotation, I decided to adjust and took a hybrid appraoch.
            </p>

            <img src="img/final/19.png" width=1200></a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="img/final/20.png" width=1200></a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="img/final/22.png" width=1200></a>

            <p>
                After modeling in Rhino, I laser cut the cardboard base and side panel. This hybrid approach of PLA and cardboard exterior allowed the music box
                to still handle the forces produced by cogwheel rotations.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3>Music Box Comb</h3>

            <img src="img/final/23.png" width=1200></a>

            <p>
                I had originally planned to order a music box comb instead of making one myself by milling out brass sheets. However, the music box comb that arrived
                was too small to be feasibly fit into the 3d printed music box exteriors. To save time, I decided to use the originally 3d printed music box's comb.
                I was not able to meet my stretch goal of milling out my custom music box comb.
            </p>

            <img src="img/final/27.png" width=1200></a>

            <p>
                The downside to this approach is that I wouldn't be able to tune the comb at all. I did not account for the ways in which I could tune the comb, but
                using approaches like metal bar to stop each tick of the comb could potentially be helpful in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
                The final construction of the music box is shown above. It is extremely out of tune, but does play various notes, which I think could be a test on
                the efficacy of printing out musical artifacts through digital fabrication methods.
