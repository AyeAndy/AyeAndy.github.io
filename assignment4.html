            Instead of milling, I decided to stay home and work within my limited time to make a box out of my 3d printer.
            In Rhino, I created a very simple panel with indents and extrusions that would fit together.

            </p>
            <p>
            The first printed parts did not work or fit well. I had made the indents the same exact size from the portruding parts,
            so I decided to change the sizes of the indents to make them a little bit bigger. I also made the overall width
            of the parts bigger as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="img/assignment4/second_try.jpg" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            In the second try, the parts were fit too loosely so they were falling apart. Finally, I made the decision to adjust back
            the parts so that indents would be smaller

            </p>
            <p>
            Finally, I was able to make a box that worked pretty well on holding itself together, as well as keep some materials inside.
